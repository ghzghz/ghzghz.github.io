          Some note and strategy on running complex system migration project.
Don&amp;rsquo;t underestimate the complexity of the project A legacy business will be complicated in many different dimensions both process and organisational. It will not be possible to comprehend this complexity up front, the complexity will reveal itself during the project. Therefore what matters more is that you have the processes, tools and decision making structure in place to quickly reveal, describe and manage this complexity.

          Overview # I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on many system migration projects over the years in the arena of traditional consumer subscription and billing e.g. cable and satellite and streaming TV, broadband, IP telephony.
I wanted to write down some observations on one key aspect of these projects, that of data migration.
I will describe a technical approach that has worked well for me, as it differs from the more common approaches I have seen and used; although all approaches have pros and cons and no one project is like another.
