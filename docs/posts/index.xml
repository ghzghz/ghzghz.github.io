          Overview # I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on many system migration projects over the years in the arena of traditional consumer subscription and billing e.g. cable and satellite and streaming TV, broadband, IP telephony.
I wanted to write down some observations on one key aspect of these projects, that of data migration.
I will describe a technical approach that has worked well for me, as it differs from the more common approaches I have seen and used; although all approaches have pros and cons and no one project is like another.
